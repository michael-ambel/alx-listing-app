# ALX Listing App

## About the Project

The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to enhance maintainability and scalability. Below is an overview of the key directories:

- **components/**
  This directory contains reusable React components used throughout the application. These components include UI elements, layout structures, and functional modules.

- **interfaces/**
  This directory defines TypeScript interfaces for maintaining type safety across the application. These interfaces outline the structure of data models and props.

- **constants/**
  This directory holds application constants, such as configuration values and reusable strings, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy in the codebase.

- **public/assets/**
  This directory contains static assets like images, icons, and other files used in the project. It ensures easy access to public resources.
